# Giro_Della_Mappa

# Project Overview
The project will be a place for Portland area bike riders or hikers to gather digitally with the intent of hosting and/or finding social events.

# Functionality
The functionality will have two main parts, "host a ride" and "find a ride". 
If you click host a ride, this is where the main model will present itself, you'll have the ability to input a ride for others to find, or make it private with a special url to direct your friends to your private ride.

I'd like to stress I won't be doing a live tracker until after the class is over, that is a long term goal. Short term for the final project to present will be the ability to add way points on a map so your friends, if not able to make the start of your ride, can find you later on in the day or evening. 

# Data Model
The way I figure the model needs to be setup is:

host_a_ride(model.Models):
    Ride name:
    Author: 
    Start time:
    End time:
    Start location:
    Way points: will allow the user to post way points with estimated 
    End location:
(I eventually would like to build a React Native mobile app to implement live tracking features)
